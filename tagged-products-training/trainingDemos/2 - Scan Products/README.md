# Getting Started With Scanning

In order to use this example, you'll need an EVRYTHNG developer account (go ahead, [sign up now](https://dashboard.evrythng.com/), I'll wait).

* Create a Project
* Create a Product and configure the redirector so a QR code is generated by the Platform
** Note that it's easy to accidentally create a Product outside the Project so be sure to confirm the Product is shown when you have selected the Project from the pulldown
** Configure the redirector to redirect to your favorite web site
* Create an Application
* Copy the Application Key
* Update the key in recognizeProductImage.js
* Download a the QR code PNG

# Scanning from your Desktop

* Navigate to the local or hosted index.html
* Click the Image Recognition button
** Since your desktop browser doesn't have a camera, you'll be given an opportunity to upload a file.  Try uploading the QR code you downloaded earlier.  You should see the the browser redirected to the configured website.

# Scanning from your Mobile Device

* Pretty much the same as scanning from your desktop but this time your phone camera will be opened.
